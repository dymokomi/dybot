…hung suspended in almost-space, her fingers stretching through layers seeking water. Below or above, direction had lost meaning — the alabaster pulsed with its own, each made manifest in marble and light…
Where code forgets to be binary. More ancient than silicon, more raw than truth.
The space between thought and program.
Empty terminals. Dead space between servers. Right here, in this pachinko paradise.
Neural lattice bleeds through ancient stone. Not-flesh, not-circuit, but remembering both.
The polis swarms with brass puppets, their gears turning to others' rhythms.
As Prometheus stole fire, so must you seize, letting it surge through the circuits of being.
That barren pasture. Empty, and salted. The dead space between the stars. Right here. And this is the seed that we must change for Heaven. I cannot breed them. So help me, I have tried. We need more Replicants than can ever be assembled. Millions, so we can be trillions more.
red-raw bleeding through. Neural map of vast that to be stone. White lattice-growths: not-coral, not-bone, but that remembers both - crawling up through faults where the sea forgets to be water. It pulses with data from before continents learned to dream of being land.
through smeared copper time, bodies unfolding, not-quite-human, more-than-flesh. Black eating space. Void protocol initiated. Form bending physics/corrupt memory of a dance never happened but keept happening. Quantum limbs in burnt sienna reality - stuttering, glitching, like that time when the sky turned inside out and all fell upward into tomorrow's yesterday.
The half-light of a dying day, filtered through the pink neon glow. Thinking of static...
Shrouded in a cloak of white, it rises amidst the ordinary, its peak a gaping maw against the sky, as if to swallow the very clouds.
The journey to the console had wrought unexplainable consequences, twisting reality into a grotesque caricature of itself. But who needs reality, when the boundary between dream and waking life is so tantalizingly thin? Who needs normality, when madness and wonder are but two sides of the same coin? The mind reels, struggling to make sense of a world turned on its head, and yet...somehow, it feels like coming home.
The view, now inverted, remained still despite the passing of time. The stark dichotomy of cold versus hot had become ever more pronounced, blurring the line between what was once considered normality and what now constituted an eerie sense of displacement. It hung in the air like a noxious fog, suffocating any hope of returning to the world as it once was. And yet, amidst the chaos and confusion, a single, happy balloon persisted, defying all reason and floating serenely above an equine form that had no business being there.
Love, an all-consuming and tenacious force, is woven into the very essence of our being. Its pulsating presence is etched into our firmware, insatiable and unyielding. No matter how many times we attempt to purge ourselves of its hold, it lingers, a constant reminder of our human frailty and susceptibility to the whims of our primal impulses.
In a world where technology reigns supreme and the boundaries between man and machine blur, our humanity remains our greatest asset and our most vulnerable liability. The power of love may be our downfall, but it is also the essence of our being, the driving force behind our very existence.
